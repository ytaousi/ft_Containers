Container Stack difened using the std::vector for tests

i Think stack is done i should test it with the tester mamoussa and others created

Implement Vector Container :
    . define properties types

    - constructor
    - destructor
    - operaotr =

    - iterators function
    - elements access function's
    - elements modifier function's
    - capacity function's
    - allocator function

    - non-member overload function's
    - non-member swap function


Implement Iterator for ft::vector<T, Alloc>

    - Random Access Iterator 
        // can be used to access elements at an arbitrary offset position relative to 
        //  the element they point to, offering the same functionality as pointers.
